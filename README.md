## About This Project

This repository contains my Google Data Analytics capstone project, where I analyze bike-share data from Cyclistic to understand user behavior and provide actionable recommendations for increasing memberships.

### Objective

The goal of this case study is to identify differences between casual riders and annual members, helping Cyclistic improve their marketing strategies to convert casual riders into members.
